You know my face is masked by the darkness, otherwise you’d see a young girl’s blush on my cheeks for everything you heard me say tonight. I wish I could have thought about the way I said it. I wish I could deny what I said. But oh well, goodbye formality! Do you love me? I know you’ll say yes and I’ll believe you. But if you swear it, I worry that you might be lying. As they say, “CS457{J0v3_l4ugh5_4t_l0v3r5_b3tr4y4l5}.” Oh, gentle Romeo, if you do love me, tell me with good faith. Or, if you think I’ve been won over to quickly, I can pout and play hard to get so that you’ll have to woo me. But if you don’t think that I’m too hasty to fall in love, I would not refuse you for the world.
